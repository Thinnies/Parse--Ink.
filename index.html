          <h1>Parse--ink.</h1>
          <p>Online library with links to free e-literature (short stories, novels, novellas, and poems) of Classics and many, many great new to present-day authors and true to present-past-few eras authors who have written some of the greatest works ever. Now all-in-one site, research and time has enabled the making of this site for anyone to use to read for free any of the literature of their choosing if available. There are more features available related and extra, however: a blog you can post with issues or essays about books you&#39;ve read and would like to critique or how your day went or how you feel, you get the point. It is there for you as a signed up user to do what you please with it. The blog could be a doorway where you propose an interesting issue that perhaps begins a conversational bit for our forum where people can talk about reading, writing, favorite music, this era today and how it is difference from the baby boomers children, religious issues, anything theme-related to talk about and hopefully learn from. This is a learning library to have fun with and use with no library card required and no late fees ;)!</p>
